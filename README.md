Hi Guys, in this project i develop the Cart-functionality (E-commerce App) using the React-Router-Dom .
in this project I used TAILWIND CSS for styling the APP and the i styled with responsive CSS.
  i used componenents like Header, Footer, category.jsx, layout.jsx, ProductsBox.jsx, ProductList.jsx and categoryBox.jsx
  for functionality i used Cart, Home and Products.jsx
  i used the several React Hooks like UseEffect, UseState, USeRef and useContext etc. 
  i used the FakeStore API for fetch the products Image for my UI, for that i use Fetch, Async and await function .
